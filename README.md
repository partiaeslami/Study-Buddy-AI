# Study-Buddy-AI
Senior Project where I use Natural Language Processing Techniques for Question Generation through a Sequence to Sequence model

question_generation.ipynb is a notebook that requires these following installs
tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib

if one wishes to run and compile the model for themselves
./saved_models/ contains model, vocabulary and index to be able to load into tensorflow and run successfully

minimum requirements to train model are

8gb ram, and intel core i5 3.1 Ghz
